# Computer Vision RPS
## Milestone 1
I am using `.git` and GitHub to keep track of my progress whilst developing this project. To begin, I set up a GitHub Repository and called it Computer Vision Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Milestone 2
I created an image project model using a website called Teachable-Machine. Within this model, I have created 4 classes - Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing which will be used within the project. Each class is trained with a bunch of images of myself showing each action of rock, paper, scissors and lack of action in 'Nothing'. I have used around 100 images in each class to make the model more accurate.

I have then exported the model which I will later use as the structure and parameters of my deep learning model.

## Milestone 3
This milestone is all about creating a virtual environment for me to work within specific for this project. It requires a number of dependencies such as `pip`, `opencv-python`, `tensorflow` and `ipykernel`.

As I am working on an M1 Pro Mac Chip, `tensorflow` was not so simple to install and required a lot more steps. Due to this, I have called my virtual environmant `tensorflow_env` so that if I am ever using `tensorflow` again in the future, I can just activate this same environment.

Once everything I needed was installed and I was happy with the virtual environment I have created, I ran the following code to test that my model was working as expected.
